      title: Service Heatmap
      desc: "OpenNMS can monitor a large number of devices and services, which means that administrators need to see a broad overview of network problems. The new heatmap feature in OpenNMS provides a visual representation of the detected problemsâ€™ severity. In order to find specific problematic nodes, simply click the area of interest, which incrementally narrows the focus of the heatmap."

      desc: "Backshift is a new graphing library built into OpenNMS allows the user to leverage alternative time series data storage solutions. Because Backshift follows the same syntax as RRDTool, pre-defined data visualizations will continue to function properly."

      desc: "OpenNMS includes a set of geographical maps (Open Street Map, Google Maps, or MapQuest) that display nodes with address asset information on a world map, including dynamic alarm status. A node requires a longitude and latitude in its assets, or an address that can be converted to longitude and latitude, in order to render on the geographic map."

      desc: "OpenNMS maintains a plugin for Grafana that exposes all collected metrics (i.e. values from .rrd or .jrb files). Metrics from multiple nodes or even multiple instances can be grouped together along with mathematical expressions to form custom charts and dashboards."

## Some of Our Latest Work

Here are some of our latest projects which are currently in development and others have been recently finished.
The newest features will be merged into OpenNMS Horizon, where they will be tested and improved upon until they are stable enough to be released into OpenNMS Meridian.
