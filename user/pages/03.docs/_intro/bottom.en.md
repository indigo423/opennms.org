# Advanced Installation Guide

OpenNMS can be installed several operating systems.
Otherwise you can run OpenNMS with different technologies to store and read time series data like [RRDtool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) or [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) with [Newts](https://opennms.github.io/newts/).
You can find detailed installation instructions in the [Install Guide](https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-install/guide-install.html) section.
