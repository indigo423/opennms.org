# Guides

The OpenNMS project divides its documentation up according to the role of the user.

+ It is helpful to start with the *User Guide*, which gives general insights into OpenNMS operations and concepts.
+ The *Administrator Guide* will help those who want to build or change the configuration of OpenNMS to implement new monitoring use cases or to perform general maintenance.
+ The *Developer Guide* provides all information required to change the OpenNMS source code.

This documentation is released and tied to specific OpenNMS versions and is part of the OpenNMS Source Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/tree/develop/opennms-doc).
