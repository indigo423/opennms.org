In the last week we worked on ICMP updates, Jetty, Minion, ElasticSearch, and bug fixing.

Github Project Updates
----------------------

* __ICMP Updates__

  My changes to JNA, JICMP, and JICMP6 have been merged into develop for inclusion in 19.0.0.

* __Dependency Updates__

  Jesse did some more work on upgrading to the latest Jetty.

* __Minion__

  Christian and Seth worked on making Minions monitorable from the OpenNMS server.  Chandra did more work on querying DNS from the minion's point-of-view. Chandra and Seth worked on a number of Minion-related events (registration/deletion/etc).  I worked on fixing some Minion RPM packaging issues.

* __ElasticSearch Support__

  Seth worked on support for forwarding events to ElasticSearch.

* __Bug Fixes__

  We've been spending time fixing a bunch of smaller bugs and starting to identify blockers for 19.0.0, due in the next few months.
