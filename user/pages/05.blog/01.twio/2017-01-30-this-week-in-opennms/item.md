In the last week we worked on documentation, internals, testing, minion, web UI, and bug fixes.

## Github Project Updates

  Ronny worked on using AsciiBinder for nicer documentation rendering.

* __Internals and Testing__

  Jesse refactored a bunch of data collection code.  Seth cleaned up sink aggregation code to be more reusable.  Seth did more work on performance of Elasticsearch forwarding.  Dustin did more work on cleaning up resource APIs.  I wrapped up my work on cleaning up smoke test failures.  Jesse did more work on improving WSman support.  Seth worked on upgrading our embedded Quartz to 2.2.

* __Minion__

  Christian added `%nodelocation%` to available event expansion parameters.

* __Web UI__

  Markus worked on a more flexible lightweight javascript-only replacement for node maps.  Jesse did more work on upgrading Jetty to 9.4.

* __Bug Fixes__

  We've been spending time fixing blockers and other bugs for 19.0.0, due early this year.
