It's time for This Week in OpenNMS!  In the last week we worked on various internal and web UI changes.

## Github Project Updates

* __Internals, APIs, and Documentation__

  * Jesse fixed an issue with WS-Man thresholding.
  * Jesse fixed an issue with the HikariCP strategy failing to get new connections with a busy database.
  * Jesse did some initial work on fixing Java9 builds.
  * Antonio worked on some Enlinkd and topology bugs.
  * I worked on creating a JavaScript API for interacting with OpenNMS servers.
  * Ronny worked on documentation for the alarm alerts.

* __Web__

  * Christian worked on the ReST session code some more.
  * Craig and Jeff wrapped up the alarm alert browser support.
  * Jesse worked on various web UI bugs.

## Office Move

The OpenNMS Group has moved offices to Apex, NC.  This included moving a server closet full of equipment from one place to another and re-IP'ing a bunch of publicly-facing sites.  On the bright side, we've come out the other end with faster office internet and more IPs, so Bamboo [gets a real IP now...](https://bamboo.opennms.org/) ;)

If you notice any problems, please let us know.  If you join us for training in the future, you'll be happy to know we're now [upstairs from a brewery](http://www.southernpeakbrewery.com/).  Cheers! üçª
