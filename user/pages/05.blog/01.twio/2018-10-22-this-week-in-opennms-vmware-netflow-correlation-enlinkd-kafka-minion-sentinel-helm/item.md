It's time for This Week in OpenNMS!

Last week worked on a bunch more Horizon 23 prep, correlation engine improvements, Helm UI updates, alarm/situation acknowledgements, and much more.

## Github Project Updates

* __Internals, APIs, and Documentation__

  * I made some fixes for handling the output of newer JDKs.
  * Jesse worked on a JVM datasource for the correlation engine.
  * Christian did some fixes to timeouts in VMware vCenter handling.
  * Markus and Dustin did more work on the single-port Netflow feature.
  * Matthew added timestamp metadata and weights to vertex information generated by the correlation engine.
  * David added support for cascading acknowledgements between situations and alarms (and vice-versa).
  * Antonio continued to work on refactoring the Enlinkd codebase.
  * Chandra added timestamps to situation metadata.
  * Chandra continued his work on supporting threshold alarms in correlation.
  * Sebastian did more work on improving daemon reload handling.
  * Jesse continued his work on creating a version-agnostic integration API.
  * Chandra worked on making sure SASL authentication works with Kafka on Minions and Sentinel.
  * Matthew did some work investigating the use of a graph database for the OCE cluster engine.
  * I did some work on handling flapping tests better in our Bamboo integration test runs.
  * I refactored the Minion and Sentinel assemblies to use a shared init script.

* __Web & UI__

  * I worked on handling node template variables in the Alarm Table panel in Helm.
  * Patrick worked on performance improvements in the topology UI.
  * Ronny made some UI improvements to the dashboards provided by Helm.
  * Christian did some more work on situation integration in the OpenNMS alarm browser.
  * I added support for multi-select variables in the Helm Alarm Table panel.
  * David worked on some alarm query improvements in the ReSTv2 interface.
  * Ronny worked on creating some views to ease report generation.
