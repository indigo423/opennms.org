# Dev-Jam 2016

Our eleventh developers' conference at the [University of Minnesota](https://housing.umn.edu/yudof) is in just a few days!
This is the place to go if you want to spend a week with OpenNMS core contributors to learn or share your experiences.
 We don't make a set plan for Dev-Jam. Instead, we use this time of the year to play around with new ideas, technologies or to improve things that we've never had the time to work on.
At Dev-Jam, we can spend time with other developers to learn things, have a lot of fun, and enjoy time together in real life instead of IRC, chat or email.
If you want to learn or share something with OpenNMS core contributors, this is definitely the place to go. There is a very good reason we call it the 5th season of the year.
You’re very welcome to join and you find all the details on our [Dev-Jam Wiki page](http://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Dev-Jam_2016).

# New website

As you may have noticed, we have completely reworked our website.
We have cleaned up a lot of content and improve what people wanted.
Additonally, we totally changed the management of the layout and content of the website.
Anyone can send in pull requests to add blog posts, add content, or improve the layout.
Pull Requests can be accepted and merged by the same OGP members as in the source code.
The whole page is using the open source flat file PHP framework [Grav](https://getgrav.org) and a fork of the [Deliver Theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-deliver-site).
You can find the page source and content in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opennms-forge/opennms.org).
If you have any issues with the website, please don’t hesitate and open issues on our public [JIRA](issues.opennms.org/browse/ORG).
I hope you enjoy the new website and hope we get more useful content on this page!
