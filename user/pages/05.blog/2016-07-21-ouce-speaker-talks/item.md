# OUCE 2016 - Speaker and Talks

OpenNMS User Conference: Europe (OUCE) is a series of talks about monitoring and network management with OpenNMS.
Our conference creates a time and place for the OpenNMS community to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve monitoring with the free OpenNMS software.
This years OUCE 2016 will take place at the University of Applied Science in Fulda, Germany.

You can attend the conference to get information about the latest tools and technologies used in monitoring and share your experience with other users and core contributors of OpenNMS.
The three day conference begins on 13th September with a training from David Hustace, who will explain all the possibilities of visualizing monitoring information using the new Business Service Monitoring capabilities and building performance data dashboards with Grafana.
On 14th and 15th September, our speakers give talks about the latest information and usecases for OpenNMS. Developers and contributors will also give talks about the new features and technologies currently being developed.
Additionally, we have a guest speaker sponsored by Datastax who will explain how Cassandra is used to persist and aggregate time series data at the Synchrotron - a particle accelerator in France. 

If you want to share your story or your experience the [Call For Paper](http://cfp.opennms.eu/en/ouce2016/cfp/session/new) is open until 1. August 2016.
