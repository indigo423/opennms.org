# OUCE 2016 - Speaker and Talks

The OpenNMS User Conference Europe (OUCE) is a series of conferences focused on all the things around monitoring and network management around OpenNMS.
Our conferences create a time and place for the community of OpenNMS to share infomration, discuss ideas and work together to improve monitoring with the free software OpenNMS.
The 2016 edition of the OpenNMS User Conference Europe (OUCE) will take place at University of Applied Science in Fulda.

You can join the conference to get information about latest tools and technologies used in monitoring and share your experience with users and core contributors of OpenNMS.
The 3 days conference starts 13th September with a training from David Hustace, explaining all the possibilities to visualize monitoring information using the new Business Service Monitoring capabilities until building performance data dashboards with Grafana.
The 14th and 15th September is our conference days to get latest information about how others use OpenNMS and the latest features first hand explained from developers and contributors.
Additionally we have a guest speaker sponsored from Datastax explaining how Cassandra is used to persist and aggregate time series data at the Synchrotron - a particle accelerator in France. 

If you want to share your story or your experience the [Call For Paper](http://cfp.opennms.eu/en/ouce2016/cfp/session/new) is open until 1. August 2016.
You find all detailed information about talks and speakers on our [OUCE 2016](https://ouce.opennms.eu) conference website.
