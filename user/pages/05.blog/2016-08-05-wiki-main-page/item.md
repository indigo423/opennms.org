We heard the call of duty to do **something** to get the wiki more popular or usable. So we spent some time at the DevJam to create a more structured [main page](http://wiki.opennms.org/). It contains the same content as the [old main page](http://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Old_Main_Page) but now categorized. We are still not done with it, but it is usable already.

A few thoughts about it:
### Getting Started
It is the same content like before. The pages need a review. Especially the tutorial.
Feel free to do it!
### Installation & Upgrades
All important links to the latest installation documentations and upgrade guides. 
### Tutorials
We definitely have to review the old [category construct](http://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Category:OpenNMS) we have used last year to get any structure in the wiki content and re-catgorize the wiki articles.
Help is welcome! Mark obsolete articles, update articles etc...
### Documentation
Should contain official documentation only. Everything about OpenNMS & Co. Minion, Newts, PRIS, JICMP, JICMP6 is welcome.
Feel free to add something!
### Community
We tidied out some old stuff. Otherwise it is the same content.
### Monitoring Applications / Devices
This is a new section. The idea is, to make it easier to find specific vendor support configurations, eg. event configs, datacollections and graph definitions.
Ronny [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRRVNNid5qY&index=5&list=PLsXgBGH3nG7hv4CdYVpxISdM8vZqsdxht) at the DevJam about a new [Github repository](https://github.com/opennms-config-modules/) which could make it easier to add/find/create new vendor configs in future. Some impressions?
### Tools
Different tools around OpenNMS, paste.opennms.eu to share config snippets, td.opennms.eu to analyze Thread Dumps, Source Code Browser, Issue Tracker and Continuous Integration System. 
### Lab
Development and prototype projects for new features or proof of concepts. We already added the Devjam and GSoC wikis and some projects.
### Left Toolbar
What's wrong with it? It definitely could need a review. But which content?
Suggestion: Everything which isnâ€™t accessible from the main page.
### Index
All articles in alphabetical order
### About Using This Wiki
Some things will need an update after we finished the categorize process.
