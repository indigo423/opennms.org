Ever had one of those days?

You just arrived at work, haven't yet had your first coffee,
and some customers are calling or maybe your boss is standing in your office,
asking you about the newest published security issues in e.g. kernel modules, OpenSSH, OpenSSL... whatever...

Certainly the question if and maybe why we are still affected by this bug is in sight.
And maybe why you don't know about it yet...

You definitely don't like days like this :-)

So this is an approach to prepare you for such situations.
