It's always important to work through your outages and alarm events to get an overview what happened in your system.
In some cases you won't recognize system restarts because the systems (especially VMs) nowadays do it very fast -- often faster than your polling cycle.

With SNMP enabled the hrSystemUptime can be used to detect restarts from Windows or Linux machines.
A similar concept can be used to detect restart of Java application with JMX and the JVM uptime metric.
This article describes how to use OpenNMS to use thresholds to detect server and Java application restarts and create events for alerting or logging.
