Hey folks,

maybe you still remember the discussion about the [Statusbox feature](https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/DevProjects/Status_Box) which Markus started at the [Easterhack](https://www.opennms.org/en/blog/2017-05-11-easterhack-review) session.
At that time I already liked the idea and to be honest, I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't possible to complete it on this weekend.
After some days I read Markus' comment in his [pull request](https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/pull/1483):
> As this feature was intended to be a small enhancement but a lot of issues were raised while developing this issue, I am now going to burry it.
... and I was really sad to hear that.
Certainly I could understand it.

But good things come to those who wait!
The OpenNMS guys revived the Statusbox feature at the DevJam in Montreal and they followed through to complete it!
But to cut a long story short:

In my opinion this new feature is one of the most handy features since several updates - from the point of an OpenNMS user who works everyday with OpenNMS.
It improves the usability and brings a new fancy look to the starting page.

But that's not all!
This donut graphs scale perfectly!
It doesn't matter if you have a small or big environment.
You will get a perfect overview of the actual state.

There is a [demo instance](https://demo.opennms.eu) (username: `demo`, password: `demo`) for presentation purposes.
Login and check it out!

So long,
Marcel
