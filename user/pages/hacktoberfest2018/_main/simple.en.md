Hacktoberfest is a way to celebrate open source during an entire month.
If you make 5 Pull Requests from 1st October - 31st October you get a limited free T-Shirt.
We have collected a few low level issues in a JIRA Epic called [Paper Cut Issues](https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-8191), you can pick any open issue you like, these are the ones which have a low barrier to solve.
